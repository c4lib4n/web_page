			For over 30 years now, MFH have operated as an IT Specialist delivering solutions and services to hundreds of businesses across the globe. The company started out in 1983 providing technical support services to the Financial Services sector and right from the outset we had a fundamental understanding that business was all about customer service.

			This service ethic is a core part of our DNA here at MFH, driven from the top down all the way through to our front line support technicians and a key reason why our average client relationship lasts in excess of ten years. Information Technology has seen enormous change throughout our years in business and at ERS our strategy of investment in both people and expertise has been a key driver in maintaining our lead over the competition.

			Today, the breadth of services we provide is quite remarkable for our size and enables us to punch well above our weight. Our expertise spans cloud migration services, IT infrastructure, application specialisation, software development, mobile app development and all are underpinned by our managed services and helpdesk support contracts.

			At MFH, we don’t what your business today, we want it in 10 years’ time and the only way we can guarantee this is by looking after you so well that you never want to let us go.
